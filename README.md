BlogPlatform Project 
This is a Blog Management Web Application built using Spring Boot (Java) and React.js.
The platform allows users to create, view, and manage blog posts with features for both regular bloggers and admin/editors. Bloggers can submit posts, while admins can review and approve or reject pending submissions.
